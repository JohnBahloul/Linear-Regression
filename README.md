# Linear-Regression
### Using Sklearn and it's Boston Housing Dataset, I will conduct a simple linear Regression

### It is important to perform an Exploratory Analysis while also considering a brief summary of the statical information of our dataset
### The idea is to learn how to utilize sklearn's linear regression model on a fairly clean dataset. We will cover splitting, training, and testing, followed by fitting the linear regression model to the data set.
